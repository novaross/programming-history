# Programming History

As I continue my learning journey into programming, methodologies and processes, I've decided to organize some of the interesting related events on a timeline.  
This provides a different perspective on the sequence of events that led to where we are now as an industry.

## 1958

### First High Level Functional Programming Language

John McCarthy began developing Lisp while he was in the MIT.  
Lisp is an acronym for List Processing, as linked lists are one of the Lisp's major data structures.  
The language was used in IBM 700/7000 series mainframe computers.

Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including:

- Tree data structures
- Dynamic typing
- Conditionals
- Recursion

## 1959

### Garbage Collection

Invented by John McCarthy to simplify manual memory management in Lisp.  
Garbage collection relieves the programmer from doing manual memory management.

## 1960

### Project Mercury, Test Driven Development

Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963.  
Developers working on the code for the Mercury space program used a form of Test Driven Development.  
The project was run in very short iterations (half day).  
The team applied an Extreme Programming practice where tests were written before each micro increment.

## 1962

### Simula, First Object Oriented Programming Language

Developed by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl in the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo as part of writing computer simulation programs.

Simula introduced:

- Objects
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Subclasses

Simula has influenced the creators of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) and Java (James Goosling)

## 1970

### Waterfall Model Detailed Diagram

Winston Walker Royce was a director at the Lockheed (currently Lockheed Martin) aerospace company.  
Royce started developing new methodologies for improving the management of software projects.

Winston Royce released a paper called "Managing the development of large software systems".  
Royce's paper is considered to be the paper which defines the waterfall model of software process.  
However in the paper Royce states that the waterfall process is doomed to fail.

The first time when there is experience with the software is in the testing phase. At this phase it is impossible to make major changes to the software without serious setback in resources and schedule. There is a need to modify the process in order to minimize the risk.

Winston Royce presents five additional features that must be added to the basic approach to eliminate most of the development risks:

1. Program Design
2. Document the Design
3. Do it twice
4. Plan, control and monitor testing
5. Involve the customer

The additional steps are going to cost money, but the costs to recover far exceed the additional costs of the steps.

## 1972

### C Programming Language

Developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie.  
Successor of the programming language B.  
B was developed at Bell Labs around 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.  
Since 2000, C has constantly ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index.

The TIOBE (The Importance Of Being Earnest) Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages.  
The Importance Of Being Earnest is also the name of a play written by Oscar Wilde at the end of the nineteenth century.  
By choosing this name, the founders of TIOBE emphasize their sincere and professional attitude towards customers, suppliers and colleagues.

## 1974

### Coupling and Cohesion

An article published in IBM Systems Journal by Larry Constantine and others, talks about the concepts of Coupling and Cohesion.  
Below two principles are crucial in order to design optimum module structure and interfaces.

- Cohesion: grouping of functionally related processes into a particular module
- Coupling: flow of information or parameters passed between modules, optimal coupling reduces the interfaces of modules and the resulting complexity of the software

Two modules considered coupled, when a change in module A causes a need for a change in module B.  
Coupling is considered bad for software, which cohesion considered good for software.

## 1985

### DOD-STD-2167A

Department of Defense Standard 2167A, a document which establishes "uniform requirements for software development which are applicable through the system lifecycle" which captures the waterfall approach for software development.  
The development cycle includes the below six phases:

- Requirements Analysis
- Preliminary Design
- Detailed Design
- Coding and Unit Testing
- Integration
- Testing

## 1996

### Extreme Programming

Kent Beck developed Extreme Programming software development methodology while working at Chrysler Corporation payroll system.
Extreme programming is a methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

It advocates:

- Frequent releases
- Short development cycles
- Working in pairs
- Code review
- Unit testing
- Expecting changes in customers requirements

## 2001

### Agile Manifesto

Snowbird, Utah

The word Agile was proposed by Mike (Miguel) Beedle, and accepted as the team, the word game from the book “Agile Competitors and Virtual Organizations”.  
Other words that were proposed: Adaptive, Essential, lean, lightweight.
Mike Beedle is a theoretical physicist, and his masters was about chaotic and nonlinear systems.  
This is where the idea of “teams at the edge of chaos” came from, a team that works as an adaptive system.  
The principles were written on the second day, by 8 people, seen on the background picture of the Agile Manifesto website, the rest of the group approved it.
