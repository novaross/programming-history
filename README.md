# Programming History

As I continue my learning journey into programming, methodologies and processes, I've decided to organize some of the interesting related events on a timeline.  
This provides a different perspective on the sequence of events that led to where we are now as an industry.

## 1950

### The Turing Test

In 1950, Alan Turing publishes a paper called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he speculates about the possibility to create machines that can think and proposes the "Turing Test".  
Turing Test is a test of a machines ability show intelligent behavior similar to or indistinguishable from that of a human.

The test proposes a natural language conversation between human and a machine which is observed by a human evaluator.  
The evaluator can only observe the written conversation and is aware that one of the sides is a human and the other is a machine.  
If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, then it is said that the machine has passed the test.  
Many argue that the test is far from perfect.

### Isaak Asimov Laws of Robotics

Isaak Asimov, American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University.  
The laws are to be followed by robots in his stories.

The three laws are:

- The First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
- The Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law
- The Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law

## 1956

### Artificial Intelligence

The field of artificial intelligence is founded as an academic discipline.  
The term officially introduced by John McCarthy during a workshop which marked the beginning of the discipline.

## 1958

### First High Level Functional Programming Language

John McCarthy began developing Lisp while he was in the MIT.  
Lisp is an acronym for List Processing, as linked lists are one of the Lisp's major data structures.  
The language was used in IBM 700/7000 series mainframe computers.

Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including:

- Tree data structures
- Dynamic typing
- Conditionals
- Recursion

## 1959

### Garbage Collection

Invented by John McCarthy to simplify manual memory management in Lisp.  
Garbage collection relieves the programmer from doing manual memory management.

## 1960

### Project Mercury, Test Driven Development

Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the United States, running from 1958 through 1963.  
Developers working on the code for the Mercury space program used a form of Test Driven Development.  
The project was run in very short iterations (half day).  
The team applied an Extreme Programming practice where tests were written before each micro increment.

## 1962

### Simula, First Object Oriented Programming Language

Developed by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl in the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo as part of writing computer simulation programs.

Simula introduced:

- Objects
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Subclasses

Simula has influenced the creators of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) and Java (James Goosling)

### First Computer Science Department

Formation of the first computer science department at Purdle University in West Lafayette, Indiana, United States.

## 1963

### Invention of the Computer Mouse

Douglas Engelbart was working in in Stanford Research Institute (SRI) on improving human-computer interaction.  
The goal was to find easy and efficient way to use computer interfaces.  
In 1963 he created a note in his notebook about a "bug" with 2 wheels with which it would be easier and more natural to use to input X and Y coordinate data.

### Origin of the word Daemon

The word daemon was first used by a team at MIT working on Project MAC (the Project on Mathematics and Computation).  
During the project a research was conducted into operating systems, artificial intelligence and theory of computation.  
John McCarthy (inventor of Lisp) was one of the team members.

The use of the word was inspired by the Maxwell's daemon, which is a thought experiment to violate the second law of thermodynamics (entropy, direction of a natural process).  
Maxwell's daemon was an imaginary agent which helped sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in the background.

## 1966

### Theory of Self Reproducing Automata

John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath (an individual who's knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects).  
The paper is a thought experiment into the possibility of creating self replicating pieces of code and describes how a computer program could be designed to replicate itself.  
Von Neumann's design is considered to be the first computer virus, and Von Neumann considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.

## 1970

### Waterfall Model Detailed Diagram

Winston Walker Royce was a director at the Lockheed (currently Lockheed Martin) aerospace company.  
Royce started developing new methodologies for improving the management of software projects.

Winston Royce released a paper called "Managing the development of large software systems".  
Royce's paper is considered to be the paper which defines the waterfall model of software process.  
However in the paper Royce states that the waterfall process is doomed to fail.

The first time when there is experience with the software is in the testing phase. At this phase it is impossible to make major changes to the software without serious setback in resources and schedule. There is a need to modify the process in order to minimize the risk.

Winston Royce presents five additional features that must be added to the basic approach to eliminate most of the development risks:

1. Program Design
2. Document the Design
3. Do it twice
4. Plan, control and monitor testing
5. Involve the customer

The additional steps are going to cost money, but the costs to recover far exceed the additional costs of the steps.

## 1971

### Creeper, the first Computer Virus

The Creeper program is often regarded as the first computer virus.  
It was designed by Bob Thomas at BBN as a security test to see if a self replicating program was possible.  
BBN (originally Bolt, Beranek and Newman Inc) started at MIT and is known for DARPA sponsored research and development company.  
Key player in inventing the internet, BBN registered the domain `bbn.com` on 24 April 1985, making it the second oldest domain name on the internet.  
John McCarthy was a consultant at BBN. On 209 the company was fully acquired by Raytheon.  
Email was invented at BBN on 1971, including the use of `@` sign in an email address.

## 1972

### C Programming Language

Developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie.  
Successor of the programming language B.  
B was developed at Bell Labs around 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.  
Since 2000, C has constantly ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index.

The TIOBE (The Importance Of Being Earnest) Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages.  
The Importance Of Being Earnest is also the name of a play written by Oscar Wilde at the end of the nineteenth century.  
By choosing this name, the founders of TIOBE emphasize their sincere and professional attitude towards customers, suppliers and colleagues.

## 1974

### Coupling and Cohesion

An article published in IBM Systems Journal by Larry Constantine and others, talks about the concepts of Coupling and Cohesion.  
Below two principles are crucial in order to design optimum module structure and interfaces.

- Cohesion: grouping of functionally related processes into a particular module
- Coupling: flow of information or parameters passed between modules, optimal coupling reduces the interfaces of modules and the resulting complexity of the software

Two modules considered coupled, when a change in module A causes a need for a change in module B.  
Coupling is considered bad for software, which cohesion considered good for software.

## 1985

### DOD-STD-2167A

Department of Defense Standard 2167A, a document which establishes "uniform requirements for software development which are applicable through the system lifecycle" which captures the waterfall approach for software development.  
The development cycle includes the below six phases:

- Requirements Analysis
- Preliminary Design
- Detailed Design
- Coding and Unit Testing
- Integration
- Testing

### Symbolics, First Registered Domain

The first internet domain that was ever registered was `symbolics.com`.  
It belonged to Symbolics Inc., a computer manufacturer that designed and built single user machines designed to run the the programming language lisp.  
Symbolics was a spin off from the MIT AI Lab.

## 1986

### Scrum

First use of the term "Scrum" in a paper called "The New New Product Development Game" by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka.  
The authors provide an approach to product development for increased speed and flexibility.  
The approach is build upon case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer industries.

## 1996

### Extreme Programming (XP)

Kent Beck developed Extreme Programming software development methodology while working at Chrysler Corporation payroll system.  
C3: Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System.  
The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of software development are taken to "extreme" levels.  
Extreme programming is a methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

Extreme programming takes the best practices to extreme levels.

It advocates:

- Frequent releases
- Short development cycles
- User Stories
- Story Points
- Working in pairs
- Test Driven Development
- Code review
- Unit testing
- Communication
- Simplicity
- Short feedback loops
- Expecting changes in customers requirements

### Story Points

Invented by Ron Jeffries as part of XP.  
Story points are originally an XP idea, also adopted by Scrum methodology.

Originally, stories were estimated in time units.  
The term "ideal day" was used, where the developers are not bothered by external interferences.  
An estimation was suggested where tree real days are required to get the work done of an "ideal day".  
The stakeholders were confused as to how a days work would take three days to get done.  
To prevent comparison with time, the team started to say "Points" instead of "Ideal Days".

An attempt to normalize and compare teams based on story points is not advised.

## 2001

### Agile Manifesto

Snowbird, Utah

The word Agile was proposed by Mike (Miguel) Beedle, and accepted as the team, the word game from the book “Agile Competitors and Virtual Organizations”.  
Other words that were proposed: Adaptive, Essential, lean, lightweight.
Mike Beedle is a theoretical physicist, and his masters was about chaotic and nonlinear systems.  
This is where the idea of “teams at the edge of chaos” came from, a team that works as an adaptive system.  
The principles were written on the second day, by 8 people, seen on the background picture of the Agile Manifesto website, the rest of the group approved it.
